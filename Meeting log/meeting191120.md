### Value Proposition 

```
- What kind of value we can give to the users?
- How can we transfer the value ?
```

- A todolist service.
- Recording daily life.
  - Can only check/uncheck today's todo.
  - What have been done or left undone can't be changed if the day passed.



## Ratio Issue

- How are we going to calculate the ratio each day?

```
Showing the ratios in each day
```

- (accomplished todos) / (sum of all the todos in a day) ? 
- weighted average?
- calculate via features? 



## New Feature Ideas

- Todo template
  - Preset todolists with various categories 

- Todo scheduling 
  - a feature that the users can custom the duration, rate and level of importance on their todo.
